# Frontend Audit: Deterministic Log Generation for RISC0 Proving

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

## Executive Summary

The Pong-a-bing-bong frontend implementation is **ready for production use** with RISC0 zkVM validation. The system achieves deterministic game log generation through:

- ✅ Q32.32 fixed-point arithmetic using BigInt (zero floating-point in physics)
- ✅ Deterministic LCG RNG matching Rust implementation exactly
- ✅ Hardcoded CORDIC constants verified against Rust prover
- ✅ Event limit enforcement (10,000 max) preventing prover rejection
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (21 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Clean separation of deterministic logic vs presentation layer

## Architecture

```
TypeScript Frontend → Compact Log (JSON) → Rust RISC0 Prover → zkVM Proof
```

**Log Format:**
```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "config": { seed, width, height, ... },
  "events": ["1030792151040", "634120936560", ...]
}
```

Each event pair represents paddle Y positions as BigInt strings in Q32.32 format.

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed-Point Arithmetic ✅

**Location:** `src/pong/fixed.ts`

**Key Points:**
- All physics use Q32.32 format (32 bits integer, 32 bits fractional)
- CORDIC constants are **hardcoded** (no longer computed from Math functions)
- Constants match Rust prover exactly (verified by tests)
- Runtime operations are pure BigInt - no floating-point contamination

**Important Functions:**
- `toFixed()` - Only for initialization (config → fixed-point)
- `fromFixed()` - Only for rendering (fixed-point → display)
- Never use these in physics calculations!

### 2. CORDIC Constants ✅

**CRITICAL:** TypeScript constants must match Rust exactly!

```typescript
// src/pong/fixed.ts
export const PI_Q32: I = 13493037705n
const K: I = 2608131496n
const atanTable: I[] = [3373259426n, 1991351318n, ...]
```

**Verification:** Run `npm test` - constant verification tests ensure alignment.

### 3. Random Number Generator ✅

**Two-RNG Design Pattern:**
```typescript
const rngPhysics = new RNG(cfg.seed)           // Affects logged state
const rngAI = new RNG((cfg.seed ^ 0x9e3779b9)) // AI decisions only
```

**Why two RNGs?**
- `rngPhysics`: Used for serve angles, bounce jitter → deterministic, affects validation
- `rngAI`: Used for AI targeting → non-deterministic, NOT validated

The validator checks paddle positions are **reachable**, not **optimal**, so AI decisions don't affect proof validity.

### 4. Event Limit ✅

**Location:** `src/pong/engine.ts:303`

```typescript
const MAX_EVENTS = 10000
if (log.events.length >= MAX_EVENTS) {
  console.warn('Event limit reached (10,000 events)...')
  state.ended = true
  return
}
```

Prevents generating logs that exceed prover's limit.

### 5. Timing vs Logic Separation ✅

**Non-Deterministic (OK):**
- `performance.now()` - Animation timing only
- `Date.now()` - Filename generation
- `Math.random()` - Initial seed generation (seed is logged)
- Canvas rendering - Visual display only

**Deterministic (Critical):**
- `step()` function - Game state updates
- All physics calculations - Fixed-point only
- Event logging - BigInt strings only

**Key Insight:** Timing determines **when** to call `step()`, not **what** `step()` does.

## Testing

**Test Suite:** `test/engine.test.ts` (21 tests, all passing)

### Test Categories

| Category | Count | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Constant Verification | 3 | Ensure TS ↔ Rust alignment |
| Determinism | 2 | Same seed = same output |
| Edge Cases | 5 | Boundary conditions |
| Fixed-Point Math | 3 | Arithmetic accuracy |
| Config Validation | 3 | Valid/invalid configs |
| Serialization | 2 | BigInt handling |
| RNG | 3 | Sequence consistency |

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run check         # TypeScript compilation
```

### Critical Test: Constant Verification

```bash
npm test -- -t "should match Rust CORDIC"
```

This test **must pass** before deploying. If it fails, TypeScript and Rust have diverged.

## Validation Rules (Prover)

The Rust prover validates logs using these rules:

1. **Config Bounds** - Dimensions, speeds, angles within safe ranges
2. **Kinematics** - Ball must reach paddle in positive time (dt > 0)
3. **Reachability** - Paddle movement ≤ max_speed × dt
4. **Bounds** - Paddles stay within field
5. **Determinism** - Bounces use seed-based RNG + fixed-point
6. **Commitment** - SHA-256 hash binds proof to specific log

## Known Limitations

### None Critical

All previous limitations have been resolved:

- ✅ ~~CORDIC constants computed from Math~~ → Now hardcoded
- ✅ ~~No event limit enforcement~~ → Now enforced at 10,000
- ✅ ~~No constant verification tests~~ → Now verified automatically
- ✅ ~~Unclear documentation~~ → Comprehensively documented

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run `npm test` - All tests must pass
- [ ] Run `npm run check` - TypeScript must compile
- [ ] Verify CORDIC constants match Rust (automatic in tests)
- [ ] Test round-trip: Generate log → validate with prover → verify scores match
- [ ] Check console for any warnings or errors

## Round-Trip Testing

**Manual verification procedure:**

```bash
# 1. Generate log in frontend
npm run dev
# Play game, download log

# 2. Validate with Rust prover
cd prover
cargo run --release -- ../pong-log_*.json

# 3. Verify output
# Expected: "FAIR GAME" with matching scores
```

## Maintenance Notes

### When changing physics:

1. **Update both TypeScript AND Rust** - Algorithms must match exactly
2. **Run tests** - Ensure constants still align
3. **Test round-trip** - Generate log → validate with prover
4. **Update documentation** - Keep AGENTS.md in sync

### When adding features:

1. **Avoid floating-point** - Use fixed-point for anything logged
2. **Test determinism** - Same seed should produce same output
3. **Add tests** - Verify new code doesn't break validation
4. **Update event limit** - If adding new event types

### When debugging validation failures:

1. **Check console logs** - "GAME" vs "VALIDATE" events
2. **Verify constants** - Run constant verification test
3. **Test with known good log** - Use example logs from repo
4. **Compare RNG sequences** - Seed=0 becomes 1?

## Performance

- **Frontend:** Real-time gameplay at 60 FPS
- **Log size:** ~2 KB for 50 events (typical match)
- **Validation:** < 1 second for typical logs
- **Proof generation:** 30-120 seconds (depends on event count)

## Security Considerations

**What the system proves:**
- ✅ Game was played according to deterministic rules
- ✅ No paddle teleportation or speed violations
- ✅ Scores are correct based on logged positions
- ✅ Physics calculations are consistent

**What the system does NOT prove:**
- ❌ Players played optimally (AI is not validated)
- ❌ Logs weren't cherry-picked (need commitment before play)
- ❌ Game config is "fair" (config validation is basic)

## Conclusion

The frontend implementation is **production-ready** for RISC0 zkVM validation. All critical determinism requirements are met, tested, and documented. The system generates compact, verifiable game logs that can be cryptographically proven using RISC Zero's zkVM.

### Strengths

1. **Pure determinism** - Fixed-point arithmetic eliminates float non-determinism
2. **Verified constants** - Automated tests ensure TS ↔ Rust alignment
3. **Clean architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Robust validation** - Multiple layers of integrity checks
5. **Well-tested** - 21 tests covering all critical paths
6. **Documented** - Comprehensive guides for development and testing

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Integration testing** - Automated round-trip tests (frontend → prover)
2. **Performance benchmarks** - Track proof generation time
3. **UI improvements** - Visual feedback for event limit approaching
4. **Advanced validation** - Pre-game commitment for anti-cherry-picking
